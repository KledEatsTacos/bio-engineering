# Bio-Engineering

This is my first assignment for my Data Structures class. The program provides various operations on DNA sequences including crossover, mutation, and automated operations.

## Features
- **Crossover**: Combine two chromosomes at specified indices.
- **Mutation**: Mutate a specific gene in a chromosome.
- **Automated Operations**: Perform a series of predefined operations from a file.
- **Print to Screen**: Display all DNA sequences.

## How to Use
1. **Crossover**: Select option 1 and enter the indices of the two chromosomes.
2. **Mutation**: Select option 2 and enter the chromosome index and gene index.
3. **Automated Operations**: Select option 3 to perform operations from `Islemler.txt`.
4. **Print to Screen**: Select option 4 to display all DNA sequences.
5. **Exit**: Select option 5 to exit the program.


## Notes
- Ensure the `Dna.txt` and `Islemler.txt` files are in the same directory as the executable.
- The interface is built using C++.

This assignment is covered with my blood and sweat.
